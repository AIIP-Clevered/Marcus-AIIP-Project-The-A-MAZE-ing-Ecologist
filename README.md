# About the App…
## Mazes... long twisty corridors with many twists and turns. 
### (In line with the 17 Sustainable Goals)
My project is to generate an Adventure Maze using voice recognition. Ex.- “Move forward, back, top etc.” 
There are 3 levels in this game.

# How to Play- 
The player has to find a way through the maze while avoiding the bombs, ghosts and ghouls.  They will have to collect trash but watch out for hidden keys to collect points. Remember there is a time limit… 

# Enter Level 2 and 3 
The maze keeps getting more complicated as you advance each level.
